# Snaprazzle
A quick selfie app & [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snaprazzle), built with [electron](https://electronjs.org/).

Snaprazzle streams video from the user's webcam and allows the user to snap a selfie with the click of a button.  The user may select to snap a single photo, or a series of three photos with a one second pause in-between.

Snaprazzle will save photos to a `Snaprazzle` directory on the user's desktop (the Snaprazzle directory will be created automatically if one does not already exist).

Also included is an optional black & white filter.
